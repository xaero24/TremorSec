A tool for detecting and analyzing motor impairment in Parkinsons

The tool sits in the background in the patient's computer and "listens" to his/her typing. A keylogger is incorporated to access the typing process and analyze the degree (and if the condition has worsened) of a Parkinsons patient.

The data is encrpyted and processed locally, and the result is sent for evaluation to a remote server.
